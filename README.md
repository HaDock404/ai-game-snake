# AI Snake Game

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Here is my dashboard presenting a data analysis of a Snake game I created in another repository. This project explain the methodology of data retrieval as well as its processing in order to grasp how the testers of our Snake game play.  

## Description  

Different sensors make it possible to recover the movements of the snake in the Snake Game, then are sent to an API allowing the players' playing methods to be analyzed in order to carry out a gameplay study. Then I recovered the database with sqlite3 and analysed them.
